Hello
## Project Descriptio
In this project, we are going to address the problem of student depression, which affects both well-being and academic performance. 
We want to solve the challenge of identifying which students are at risk of depression by applying data mining techniques.
Our objectives include classifying students into categories of “depressed” and “not depressed,” as well as clustering them into groups with similar characteristics. 
Through this, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns that can support early detection and provide valuable insights for improving student mental health.
