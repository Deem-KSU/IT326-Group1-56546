## Project Description:

In this project, we are going to address the problem of student depression, which affects both well-being and academic performance. 
We want to solve the challenge of identifying which students are at risk of depression by applying data mining techniques.
Our objectives include classifying students into categories of “depressed” and “not depressed,” as well as clustering them into groups with similar characteristics. 
Through this, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns that can support early detection and provide valuable insights for improving student mental health.

## Project Motivation :

Student mental health is considered one of the most significant challenges in the modern era, especially with the increasing academic, social, and financial pressures. Many studies indicate that depression among students in educational stages can negatively affect academic performance, productivity levels, and overall quality of life. We have chosen this problem because it addresses an essential aspect of students’ lives, which is mental health. Data analysis helps us understand the factors that may lead to depression, opening the door to developing solutions and strategies for early intervention and student support.
